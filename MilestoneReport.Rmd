## Introduction

  This project is based on the Kaggle competition for AirBnB, located at https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data. AirBnB is a service that allows users to rent their homes out on a short term basis for travelers. Therefore, it is very advantageous to the company to track where users book vacations from their website in order to predict where travelers using their service will want to go. Based on a user's demographic data, web session data, and some summary statistics, the goal of this competition is to predict where a first-time traveler's booking destination will be. Based on this information, AirBnB can modify their website and marketing to better target their customers. 
  
##Project Goals

  The first, and most obvious step involves using demographic data to predict booking destination. It is likely that age, gender, booking date, and language of origin will all be significant factors in deciding a destination. Interestingly enough, AirBnB allows "Other" as a choice of gender. Though relatively few people picked this option, it could provide interesting insight into the travel habits of the growing genderfluid community and provide valuable marketing information to this segment of the population. 
  
  Analyzing the session data will be more challenging. I admittedly have little experience in web design, and preliminary forays into this data set have proven more confusing than enlightening. The dataset records every action taken by users, the time to each action, and the device used. However, there are approximately 1.8 million distinct actions that the users can take, making interpreting this data very difficult. I suspect that only metadata can be gleaned from this, and I'm not sure how useful it can be. Nevertheless, the dataset was included for a reason, so there must be some way this information can prove useful. If nothing else, I would like to figure out the recorded action for finalizing a booking, so at the very least I can figure out the average time taken to book a trip and use that along with demographics to make further predictions. However, gleaning out which action out of the 1.8 million actions represents finalizing a booking may prove difficult. Perhaps I can merge the datasets to list if a particular user booked a trip or not, then use that to narrow down the actions taken. 
    
    
## Data Wrangling

The dataset provided by AirBnB required relatively little wrangling. It is already close to being in tidy form, with each row representing a user, and each column representing a variable describing that user. However, I did do a few things to make analysis easier. First, I changed all strings that were either blank, "-unknown-", or "NDF" (for "No Destination Found") to "NA". I felt this standardized any missing or unknown information and further differentiated it from any "Other" strings. Secondly, I merged the country information with the demographic information to make it easier to associate any qualities of the destination country with information about the booker. I'm not sure how latitude and longitude will be helpful in making predictions, but I can't think of any reason to exclude it. Finally, I changed the dates in the dataset to Date objects instead of factors. This may make analysis easier. 

## Preliminary Analysis

<<Something about the sessions dataset here>>


I plan to do some basic logistic regression analysis on factors that lead to whether or not someone books a trip, regardless of destination. Once that's done, and once I learn a bit more about machine learning algorithms, I can attempt to go for more complicated predictions on where that destination will be.
